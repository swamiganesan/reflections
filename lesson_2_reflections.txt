makes a .git file and the empty git repo is ready

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

repository is the final stage git - archived directory

staging area is the intermediate section which is populated with files that are ready for a commit

working directory is the directory where all the files reside on the local directory


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

git status should show the files that are in staging area.
